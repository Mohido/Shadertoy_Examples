# Shadertoy_Examples and playground
A repository which contains a bunch of homemade shadertoy (fragment shader playground) examples. 

# How to run:
You can run it in multiple ways. However, the most convinient way is to install the "shader toy by adam stevenson" extension on "Visual Code". Then right click anywhere inside the file window in the Visual code and click on "Shadertoy show GLSL preview". Another window will show up containing hte actual output of the fragment shader.
The other way is to go directly to "https://www.shadertoy.com/" And then use one of the textures there or find a way to upload the image that we have to that platform. A plugin can be used (Google it). 

# Each Directory contains a specific simple example aka mini-project. All project are being rendered via Raytracing.
